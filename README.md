**Subject:** Proposal for Srt Lens Integration

---

Dear [Recipient’s Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to propose an enhancement to the Srt platform that I believe will significantly improve our ticket processing efficiency. Below is a detailed problem statement, solution, and the anticipated impact of integrating Google Lens into the Srt page.

---

### Title: **Srt Lens Integration**

---

#### **Context**  
On the Srt platform, users are tasked with processing multiple tickets containing images that need identification, such as terrorist photos or vape-related pictures. Currently, users face inefficiencies when identifying these images, as they must switch between search engines to use tools like Bing Lens. However, Bing Lens does not provide the most accurate results, and the constant switching results in unnecessary delays during the ticket processing workflow.

---

#### **Problem**  
The identification of images in Srt tickets is inefficient. Users need to frequently switch their search engine settings to utilize Bing Lens for image recognition, while Google Lens is more compatible for this task. Given the need to switch search engines for each ticket, users face significant delays when handling large volumes of tickets, such as those related to potential terrorist activities. This inefficiency increases the time spent processing tickets and can lead to bottlenecks, particularly in high-priority situations.

---

#### **Solution**  
By integrating **Google Lens** directly into the Srt page, users will have immediate access to a powerful image recognition tool without the need to switch search engines. Google Lens is more compatible and reliable for identifying images like terrorist photos and vape-related content. Embedding this tool within the Srt interface will streamline the process, reducing the time required to identify each ticket.

---

#### **Impact**  
This integration will result in significant time savings per ticket. By eliminating the need to switch between search engines, the identification time per ticket will be reduced, thereby improving overall efficiency. For instance, processing 200 tickets currently takes around 30 seconds per ticket. With Google Lens integration, this time could be halved, leading to considerable time savings.

### **Time Savings Calculation**

| **Metric**                     | **Current Time**       | **With Google Lens**  | **Time Saved**          |
|---------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Time per ticket                 | 30 seconds             | 15 seconds            | 15 seconds              |
| Tickets processed per day       | 200 tickets            | 200 tickets           |                         |
| Time saved per day              | 100 minutes (1.67 hrs) | 50 minutes (0.83 hrs) | **50 minutes/day**      |
| Time saved per month (22 days)  | 36.67 hours            | 18.33 hours           | **18.33 hours/month**    |
| Time saved per year (260 days)  | 433.33 hours           | 216.67 hours          | **216.67 hours/year**    |
| Workdays saved annually         | ~54.17 days            | ~27.08 days           | **27 workdays/year**     |

---

### **Summary of Time Saved**  
- **Time saved per ticket**: 15 seconds  
- **Time saved per day**: 50 minutes  
- **Time saved per month**: 18.33 hours  
- **Time saved per year**: 216.67 hours (~27 workdays)

---

### **Conclusion**  
By implementing Google Lens directly on the Srt page, we can significantly reduce the time taken to process each ticket. This improvement will lead to a time-saving of approximately **27 workdays per year**, enhancing operational efficiency and reducing the manual effort required for image identification.
